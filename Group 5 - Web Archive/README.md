Step-by-step to create network representations:

1. Download the ToS3 folder from the Google drive
2. Use the [export_networks](export_networks.ipynb) notebook to create the direct, copuling and colink network views for each timestamp and level.
3. All these exports are already in the [all_networks](all_networks.zip) archive.
4. Use Gephi or other means to analyse them.
