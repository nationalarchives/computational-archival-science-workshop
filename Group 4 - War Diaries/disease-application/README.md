# Disease Tracking

A simple [GATE](http://gate.ac.uk) based application that aims to annotate diseases mentiones within th transcribed War Diaries.

The application currently uses a list of diseases based on UMLS entries (T047) and tries to differentiate between mentions of the disease appearing within troops from those where they are being given information (often in the form of a lecture) on a disease.

The application is currently very simple, partly due to the amount of data available for testing, however, it is hoped that it illustrated some of the extra information that could be extracted from the War Diaries if further documents were subject to full transcription.
